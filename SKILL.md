# 4A Feedback Delivery

Deliver feedback using the 4A framework (Ask, Add, Appreciate, Accept) to transform feedback conversations from awkward confrontations into collaborative growth opportunities. This methodology, popularized by Netflix's culture of radical candor, creates a reciprocal feedback loop where both giver and receiver participate actively, ensuring that feedback is specific, actionable, and delivered with genuine care for the recipient's success.

The 4A framework recognizes that most feedback fails not because the content is wrong, but because the delivery creates defensiveness. By structuring feedback around permission-seeking, collaborative contribution, genuine appreciation, and explicit acceptance, you create conditions where difficult truths can be heard and acted upon.

## When to Use

- Delivering constructive feedback to a team member or colleague
- Providing developmental feedback in 1:1 conversations
- Addressing performance issues before they escalate
- Giving feedback to peers or even superiors
- Creating a culture of continuous improvement through regular feedback
- Receiving feedback gracefully and demonstrating openness
- Coaching others on how to give and receive feedback effectively

|-------|----------|-------------|
| feedback_content | Yes | The specific observation and impact you want to communicate |
| recipient | Yes | Who will receive the feedback and your relationship context |
| context | Yes | The situation or behavior being addressed |
| desired_outcome | No | What change or improvement you hope to see |

## Core Principle

Feedback is a gift, but gifts can be rejected if wrapped poorly. The 4A framework ensures that feedback is offered with respect (Ask), made actionable (Add), delivered with care (Appreciate), and received with ownership (Accept). All four elements must be present for feedback to drive genuine change.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Preparation

**Step 1: Clarify your observation**
Separate fact from interpretation. What specifically did you observe? When and where did it happen? Focus on behaviors, not personality traits.

**Step 2: Identify the impact**
How did the behavior affect you, the team, or the outcome? Be specific about consequences without catastrophizing.

**Step 3: Consider your intent**
Is your goal to help the person improve, or to express frustration? Only proceed if your intent is genuinely developmental.

### Phase 2: Delivery Using the 4A Framework

**Step 4: ASK - Seek permission**
Request the opportunity to share feedback. This shifts the dynamic from imposition to invitation.
- "Would you be open to some feedback on the presentation?"
- "I'd like to share an observation. Is now a good time?"
- "Can I offer a thought about how that meeting went?"

*Why this matters:* Asking creates psychological safety and ensures the recipient is mentally prepared to receive input.

**Step 5: ADD - Contribute specifically**
Share your observation and its impact in specific, behavioral terms. Add value by connecting behavior to outcome.
- "When you interrupted three times during Sarah's proposal, it seemed to discourage her from sharing more ideas."
- "I noticed the report was missing the regional data. That caused the executive team to delay their decision."
- "Your response to the client's concern came across as dismissive, which may be why they went silent."

*Key elements:*
- Specific behavior (not vague characterizations)
- Observable impact (not mind-reading)
- Actionable insight (something they can change)

**Step 6: APPRECIATE - Acknowledge the person**
Express genuine appreciation for the person, their effort, or the context that made the behavior understandable. This is not sugarcoating; it is acknowledging the full picture.
- "I know you were under pressure to finish the meeting on time, and I appreciate how much you care about efficiency."
- "Your passion for the project is exactly why I'm sharing this—I know you want it to succeed."
- "I recognize this is tough to hear, and I appreciate your willingness to listen."

*What appreciation does:* It prevents feedback from feeling like an attack on the person's character and acknowledges their positive intent.

**Step 7: ACCEPT - Invite ownership**
Create space for the recipient to accept, discuss, or contextualize the feedback. This completes the loop and moves toward action.
- "How does that land with you?"
- "What's your perspective on this?"
- "Is there context I'm missing?"
- "What would help you address this?"

*Why acceptance matters:* Feedback only drives change when the recipient takes ownership. This step transfers agency to them.

### Phase 3: Follow-Through

**Step 8: Agree on next steps**
If appropriate, collaboratively identify specific actions or check-in points.

**Step 9: Document if needed**
For significant feedback, maintain a record for future reference while respecting confidentiality.

**Step 10: Follow up**
Acknowledge improvement when you see it. This reinforces the value of the feedback exchange.

**ADD (Contribution):**
"[Your specific, behavioral observation and its impact]"

**APPRECIATE (Acknowledgment):**
"[Genuine appreciation for the person, their effort, or context]"

## Constraints

- Never deliver feedback in anger; wait until you can be constructive
- Never give feedback publicly unless it is purely positive recognition
- Never use the 4A framework to manipulate or punish; intent must be developmental
- Never stack multiple criticisms in one conversation; address one issue at a time
- Never skip the ASK step; unsolicited feedback often backfires
- Never forget APPRECIATE; criticism without appreciation damages relationships
- Avoid vague language ("you always," "you never"); be specific and behavioral
- Do not proceed if you cannot articulate a specific, observable behavior

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**The Compliment Sandwich (Fake Appreciation)**
- Wrong: Surrounding criticism with generic compliments that feel hollow
- Right: APPRECIATE should be genuine and connected to the specific situation, not forced positivity

**The Drive-By (Skipping Accept)**
- Wrong: Delivering feedback and walking away without inviting response
- Right: Accept creates dialogue; feedback should be a conversation, not a monologue

**The Ambush (Skipping Ask)**
- Wrong: Launching into feedback without checking readiness
- Right: Always ask permission; even a brief pause creates psychological safety

**The Character Assassination (Non-Behavioral Feedback)**
- Wrong: "You're disorganized" or "You don't care about quality"
- Right: "The last three reports were submitted after the deadline" is specific and behavioral

**The Pile-On (Multiple Issues at Once)**
- Wrong: Using one conversation to address every concern you've accumulated
- Right: One issue per conversation; schedule separate discussions for separate concerns

## Examples

### Example 1: Peer Feedback on Meeting Behavior

**Situation:** A colleague consistently dominates team meetings, making it difficult for others to contribute.

**Application:**

**ASK:** "Hey, I noticed something in our team meetings that I think could help us work better together. Would you be open to hearing my observation?"

**ADD:** "In the last three meetings, I noticed you spoke for about 70% of the time and sometimes jumped in before others finished their thoughts. The impact was that Priya and Marcus barely contributed, and I think we missed some of their ideas."

**APPRECIATE:** "I know your input is valuable—you have more experience with these projects than anyone—and I can see you're passionate about getting things right. That experience is exactly why I want to make sure we're also drawing out other perspectives."

**ACCEPT:** "How does that land with you? Is there something about the meeting dynamic I'm not seeing?"

**Outcome:** The colleague acknowledged they hadn't realized the pattern and suggested implementing a round-robin format for the first portion of meetings.

---

### Example 2: Manager Feedback on Missed Deadline

**Situation:** A direct report missed an important deadline, impacting a client delivery.

**Application:**

**ASK:** "I'd like to discuss the Carter project timeline. Do you have a few minutes to talk through what happened?"

**ADD:** "The deliverable was due Wednesday, and we didn't receive it until Friday afternoon. That meant the client didn't get their review time, and they expressed frustration in the call yesterday. The impact was a dent in trust we'd been building for months."

**APPRECIATE:** "I know you've been juggling multiple projects, and your work on the Morrison account has been exceptional. I'm not questioning your overall commitment; I'm focused on this specific situation because I know you want to maintain the strong relationships you've built."

**ACCEPT:** "Help me understand what happened. Were there obstacles I should know about? And what can we do differently next time?"

**Outcome:** The report revealed they were blocked waiting on input from another department and hadn't escalated. Together, they established a new escalation protocol.

---

### Example 3: Upward Feedback to a Manager

**Situation:** A manager frequently reschedules 1:1 meetings, leaving the direct report feeling deprioritized.

**Application:**

**ASK:** "I'd value your input on something that's been on my mind. Could I share an observation about our 1:1s?"

**ADD:** "In the last six weeks, our 1:1 has been rescheduled four times, often on short notice. The impact for me is that I've had questions pile up, and I've started feeling less connected to priorities because we haven't had consistent time to sync."

**APPRECIATE:** "I know your calendar is brutal and you're balancing a lot of demands. I also know you genuinely care about supporting the team—that's why I feel comfortable raising this."

**ACCEPT:** "I'm not sure if there's something I could do differently, or if there's a better time that works for your schedule. What are your thoughts?"

**Outcome:** The manager acknowledged the pattern, apologized, and protected a recurring slot on a day with fewer conflicts.

## Integration

**Works well with:**
- **radical-candor**: The 4A framework is one implementation of radical candor principles
- **difficult-conversations**: For higher-stakes feedback situations
- **coaching-questions**: To deepen the ACCEPT phase through guided inquiry
- **psychological-safety**: 4A feedback builds and depends on team psychological safety

**When to prefer this skill:**
- When you have specific, behavioral feedback to deliver
- When preserving the relationship is as important as delivering the message
- When coaching someone to improve rather than documenting for termination
- When you want to model healthy feedback culture

**When to use a different approach:**
- For urgent safety or compliance issues that require immediate correction
- When formal performance documentation is required
- When the relationship is too damaged for developmental feedback to land

**Skill boundaries:**
- This skill focuses on delivery; for receiving feedback gracefully, emphasize the ACCEPT dimension and practice it yourself
- For feedback culture at the team level, combine with regular feedback rituals and norms
